## Filing Issues

### Suggestions

The USD for 3ds Max project is meant to evolve with feedback - the project and its users greatly appreciate any thoughts on ways to improve the design or features. Please use the `enhancement` tag to specifically denote issues that are suggestions - this helps us triage and respond appropriately.

### Bugs

As with all pieces of software, you may end up running into bugs. Please submit bugs as regular issues on GitHub - 3ds Max developers are regularly monitoring issues and will prioritize and schedule fixes.

The best bug reports include a detailed way to predictably reproduce the issue, and possibly even a working example that demonstrates the issue.

## Contributing Code

The USD for 3ds Max project accepts and greatly appreciates contributions. The project follows the [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) model for accepting contributions.

It is highly recommended that an issue be logged on GitHub before any work is started.  This will allow for early feedback from other developers and avoid multiple parallel efforts.

### Pull Requests

When contributing code, please also include appropriate tests as part of the pull request, and follow the same comment and coding style as the rest of the project. Take a look through the existing code for examples of the testing and style practices the project follows. Also read and adhere to the the [Coding guidelines](CodingGuidelines.md), many of which are enforced by clang-format checks.

All development should happen against the [dev](https://github.com/Autodesk/3dsmax-usd/tree/dev) branch of the repository. Please make sure the base branch of your pull request is set to the dev branch when submitting your pull request.

All pull requests require at least one approving code reviewer.
