            <li>
                Added support for displaying USD Light shapes in the viewport. Note they do not cast lights into the viewport but can be selected and edited. The results will render in renderers with USD support.
            </li>
            <li>
                Update some labels and tooltips around the Draw Mode functions in the USD Stage Object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated the MaterialX Plugin to use MaterialX version 1.38.8 for 3ds Max 2025.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated the MaterialX Plugin to use MaterialX version 1.38.10 for 3ds Max 2026.
            </li>            
        </ul>
        Fixes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fixed some of the shipped tools such as USDView not working because of Powershell security policy settings. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed an issue where Selecting the USD Stage from a recently edited prim wouldn't always work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Animated USD attributes now refresh when scrubbing the timeline.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prevent situation where deactivating parent and child leave selection in state that can cause crash
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed incorrect progress reporting in the USD Importer.
            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>v0.9.3</h5>
        What's New:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Updated USD to version 0.24.08 for 3ds Max 2026.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated the USD Exporter to better convert Max Shapes into USD instead of always exporting to linear interpolations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added USD Layer Editor to target layers for USD edits.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated the MaterialX Material to save the current material by name instead of index. This guarantees that sub-materials in a USD remain intact in Max even if the MaterialX document changes the ordering of materials.
            </li>
            <li>
                Exposed more of the MaterialX Exporter options to MAXScript.

            <li>
                Introducing the concept of a devkit archive delivered inside the 3dsMax USD plugin installation. The devkit includes all the 3ds Max USD SDK files (includes and libs), the samples and the minimal dependencies (includes and libs) required to compile the samples (or any third-party add-on plugin for the 3ds Max USD plugin). Additionally, the devkit contains the other dependencies required to compile the open-sourced 3ds Max USD plugin (still in preparation). The previous 3ds Max USD SDK archive is not produced anymore. The devkit is its replacement.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Fixes:
        <ul>

                Updated the USD Exporter to properly bind materials to USD GeomSubsets when the material IDs on the mesh are greater than the Multimaterial numsubs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated USDView that ships with the 3ds Max USD plugin to display MaterialX.
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated the USD Exporter to use the new menu system introduced in 3ds Max 2025 branch to create the File > Reference > USD Stage... menu.
            </li>    
            <li>
                Refactored the USD Exporter code to be significantly faster at exporting complex scenes with interdependencies that are animated.

                <br/><br/>SDK CHANGES : 

                <br/>The export changes required major changes to the PrimWriter API. The PrimWriter interface now also better aligns with the ShaderWriter interface.

                <br/>All the samples were updated accordingly.

                <br/><br/>Notable changes : 
                <br/>- Every Node->Prim translation now gets its own PrimWriter instance. Previously, a single instance was created for the entire export.
                <br/>- The CanConvert() method was renamed to CanExport() and was made static. A static_assert makes sure the method exists in derived PrimWriters.
                <br/>- As a consequence, the PrimWriter's methods no longer receive a 3dsMax node as argument, instead, the node can be retrieved using PrimWriter::GetNode().
                <br/>- PrimWriter::Write() is now called multiple times on animated data, for each frame that needs to be exported.
                <br/>- New PrimWriter method GetValidityInterval() : Enables PrimWriter to specify the validity interval of their exported data at a certain time. From this, the exporter figures out at what frames PrimWriter::Write() needs to be called (base implementation returns the object's validity interval).
                <br/>- New header TimeUtils.h
                <br/>- The TimeConfig class has been modified to ease usage, all conversions TimeValue/3dsMax frame/TimeCode are now handled from there.
                <br/>- New class "ExportTime" : Represents a single time sample export configuration. I.e. the 3dsMax time value, and what USD timecode it corresponds to.
                <br/>- MeshConverter::ConvertToUSDMesh() now also receives a specific time frame to convert the mesh at.
            </li>                
        </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fixed USDStageObject.SelectRootLayerAndPrim() not returning the Payalods option. The Payloads option now returns as a boolean in the third item in the resulting array.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Removed the term "beta" from the USD plugin.

        <h5>v0.0.10</h5>
        What's New:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added maxscript callbacks for <code>UsdExporter</code>/<code>UsdImporter</code> :
                <code>#onImportComplete</code>
                and <code>#onExportComplete</code>.
                <p>
                    These callbacks are triggered before closing or writing the USD stage to disk, and are passed the
                    Usd
                    <code>stageId</code>.
                <p>
                    This allows a scripter to make additional imports/exports, such as special-case metadata handling,
                    custom
                    classes, etc.
                <p>
                    The Usd stage can be accessed during export and import time by <code>stageId</code>:
                    <br>
                <p style="background-color:whitesmoke">
                    <code>
                cache = UsdUtils.StageCache.Get()<br>
                stage = cache.Find(Usd.StageCache.Id.FromLongInt(stageId))<br>
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>The following functions are identical for <code>UsdExporter</code> and <code>UsdImporter</code>:</p>

                USDImport now adds standard USD metadata fields as custom attributes. These custom attributes export to
                USD when

            <li>
                By default, vertex colors (channel 0) are mapped to <code>primvar:vertexColor</code> (a generic primvar)
                instead of
                <code>primvar:displayColor</code> (well known usd primvar).

                    <li>
                        Output the wire color to <code>primvar:displayColor</code>, which matches the intent of that
                        primvar
                        (fast display).

                    <li>
                        Change the import mappings accordingly to recognize vertexColor on import as well / set
                        wireColor from
                        displayColor. If not a constant primvar (i.e. different colors per vertex), use the first value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All of this can still be overridden with the current system for configuring mappings, i.e.
                        should only
                        export <code>wireColor</code> to <code>displayColor</code> if no explicit mapping is set for
                        displayColor.
                        Same for import. User can always explicitly import the values to a channel if needed via script.

                        the identity matrix.</li>
                    <li>Groups/helper object transforms are properly exported. When you filter out meshes for example,

                    <li>Changes made from the UI are only applied if the Import goes through (I.e. not if you cancel or
                        close from the export window).</li>
