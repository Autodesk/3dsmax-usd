/**
 * \brief Provides functionality to register and lookup USD writer plugins
 * for 3dsMax nodes.
 *
 * Use PXR_MAXUSD_REGISTER_WRITER(uniqueName, writerClass) to register a writer
 * class with the registry.
 *
 * Prim writers derive from the PrimWriter class and are expected to implement
 * several methods to specify what objects they are able to support, and how to actually
 * perform the conversion.

 * In order for the core system to discover the plugin at export time, you need a
 * plugInfo.json specifying the plugin's type.
 * \code
 * {
 *   "Plugins":[
 *      {
 *         "Info":{
 *            "MaxUsd":{
 *               "PrimWriter" : {}
 *            }
 *         },
 *         "Name":"myTranslatorPlugin",
 *         "Type":"library",
 *         "LibraryPath":"myTranslatorPlugin.dll"
